# Determining Suitability of MLme for Your Dataset
To understand if your data and scientific question fall into the category of a classification problem, there are a few important points to consider:  

  -  Categorized Data: Your data should consist of examples that are grouped into distinct classes or categories. For example, if you're studying different species of plants, each plant should be labeled with its corresponding species name, like "rose" or "tulip.  
  
  -  Prediction Goal: Your scientific question should involve predicting or assigning these labels to new instances based on their features. For instance, you might want to predict the species of a new plant based on its petal length, petal width, and other characteristics.
